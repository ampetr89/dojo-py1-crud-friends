# CRUD Friends

A simple app to add names of people and their emails to a MySQL database. All CRUD operations (Create, read, update, delete) are possible. This application is built using Flask.


## Screenshots

### Index
At first, the friends table contains two entries

!["Friends"](/doc/index.png?raw=true "Index")


### Adding a friend
The last row in the table lets you add a new table entry. 

!["Adding"](/doc/add1.png?raw=true "Adding")

By pressing the Add button, the new entry appears in the table.

!["Added"](/doc/add2.png?raw=true "Added")


### Updating a friend
Click the Edit button to be taken to the edit page:

!["Editing"](/doc/edit1.png?raw=true "Editing")

Then press Submit to apply your changes (or Cancel to go back without saving). The table now reflects your edits:

!["Edited"](/doc/edit2.png?raw=true "Edited")

### Removing a friend
The delete button removes a record from the table.
